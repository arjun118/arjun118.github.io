> This blog assumes that you are familiar with docker and it's basic concepts such as volumes (that's the only concept we gonna use either way ðŸ˜…).

We have a flask application which is basically a social blogging site where users can register, login (ofcourse), make posts, comment, follow other users and with role based authentication implemented for granting appropriate permissions for users, moderators and admins.

Following the good practice of using a separate python virtual environments to work on different projects, i've created a virtual environment using the `venv` python module and built my application in that environment so i could keep my projects' isolated

This is how my script.py, which is the starting point of the flask application looks like. Your's might look different and it's perfectly alright!.
you can ignore FLASK_CONFIG for now, the 'default' value for FLASK_CONFIG indicates that the current environment is a developement one and not a prod one

```python
import os
from app import create_app, db
from app.models import User, Role
from flask_migrate import Migrate
app=create_app(os.getenv('FLASK_CONFIG') or 'default')
migrate=Migrate(app,db)

with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()
    Role.insert_roles()

@app.shell_context_processor
def make_shell_context():
    return dict(db=db, User=User, Role=Role)


if __name__=='__main__':
    app.run()

```

look at these three lines of code

```python
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()
    Role.insert_roles()
```

as mentioned earlier, i've implemented role based authentication (RBAC), you dont need to do `Role.insert_roles()` if you do not have any roles to begin with. But you still need to create all the database tables if you are using a database

The way `db.create_all()` works is that if a particular table related to a model does not exist in the database, it creates that table in the database. However, if a table associated with the model already exists, it won't create a new table.

Keep in mind, we need to create the database tables inside the application context of our app or else simply running `db.create_all()` won't work

Now let's take a look at the Dockerfile

```yaml
FROM python:alpine

RUN adduser -D cicada
# you can change ths user too!
USER cicada

ENV FLASK_APP=script.py
# replace script.py with the appropriate filename in your project

WORKDIR /home/cicada

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt

RUN python -m venv venv

RUN venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY app app

COPY migrations migrations

COPY script.py config.py boot.sh ./

EXPOSE 5000

ENTRYPOINT ["./boot.sh"]
```

a few points to note here,

my directory organization looks like this,(i have omitted out some files intentionally, just wanted to give you guys an idea about the organization)

- we are creating a new python environment in the using `python -m venv <name_of_the_environment>`
- we are installing all our dependencies in the new environment
- here the `app` folder is my main folder where i have the code for my application
  the contents of `boot.sh` , which is the entrypoint of our docker image are

```bash
#!/bin/sh
source venv/bin/activate

flask run  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

the requirements.txt file contains the list of modules/ dependencies that our flask application needs, you run generate this file by using the below command, just remember to activate your virtual environment before generating

```bash
source <your_environment_name>/bin/activate
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Now, it's time to build the image. Navigate to the directory where you have your Dockerfile saved and execute this

```bash
docker build -t flask_app:latest .
```

once the image is built, you can list out the images using (i've created a while ago)

```bash
â•°â”€$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY              TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
flask_app               latest    ca0ec641a957   42 minutes ago   129MB
```

let's spin up a container with this image

```bash
docker run -it -p 8000:5000 --name smapp flask_app:latest
```

we are mapping the port 5000 which will be exposed inside the container to the port 8000 on our host machine, so that we can access the site from `http://localhost:8000`

![smapp_landing_page](/images/smapp_landing.png)

Now you can interact with the website, create a user, publish a post, comment etc.

But when you restart the container, all the users, posts, comment which you may have created earlier are lost. This is where the need for volumes come in

To ensure data persistence we mount the volume to the container

lets create a volume

```bash
â•°â”€$ docker volume create smdata
smdata
```

list the available volumes

```bash
â•°â”€$ docker volume ls
DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
local     smdata
```

mounting a volume,

```bash
docker run -it --name smapp --mount source=smdata,target=/home/cicada -p 8000:5000 flask_app:latest
```

- The `source` parameter specifies the name of the volume.
- The `target` parameter defines the folder path inside the container where the volume will be mounted.

Now,even if you restart the container, your data will be persistent

Next, I will try write about how we can do this using docker-compose and an external mysql db

<!--  need to add github link for the code and  -->
